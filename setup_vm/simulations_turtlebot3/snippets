# Running the simulator with default settings:


# Running synchronous SLAM with Nav2:




=== Robot bringup ===



=== Visualization ===




=== SLAM & Nav ===
# run synchronous SLAM on a remote PC to get a higher resolution map


# Asynchronous SLAM


# visualise the map, launch Rviz2


# save the map
# --- save old map format using nav2 (.pgm, .yaml)

# --- save new serialized map format (map pose-graph) using slam_toolbox
#     useable for continued mapping, slam_toolbox localization, offline manipulation


# read the map and start navigation


=== SLAM/Nav simultaneously ===
